## Room
##### A room is the basic unit of Port7. 
Rooms consist of three main processes:
- The [[Room Process]]
- The [[Game Process]]
- The [[Chat Process]]

Rooms function as the primary process for a room object. They also serve as the main [[Peer]] container for the API.

Rooms are dynamically created and pruned when they are deemed inactive by the server.
